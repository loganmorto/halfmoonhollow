  We started Half Moon Hollow Builders in 2020 with one goal: to build homes and spaces where families can live the lives they truly want. Based in Asheville, NC, we’re a small, hands-on general contracting team that believes personal service makes all the difference.

  We specialize in custom home construction, residential remodeling, and creative design solutions—delivering craftsmanship, attention to detail, and a collaborative process from start to finish. Because we’re a small business, every client gets our full focus and care.

  Whether you’re building from the ground up or reimagining your current space, we’re here to make the process smooth, creative, and rewarding.

  At Half Moon Hollow Builders, our greatest joy comes from working with clients to bring together all the details—big and small—that reflect what matters most to them. Yes, we focus on construction and architecture, but even more importantly, we strive to design homes that reflect you—your personality, your lifestyle, and your vision. That’s our mission: to move away from the cookie-cutter approach and bring back the true meaning of a custom home.

  We’re a small, hands-on team based in Asheville, NC, and we take pride in offering a personalized building experience. Kevin brings over 25 years of experience in the construction industry, having worked with respected companies across the region. His role is centered on integrating the latest technologies and sustainable materials—choices that not only support environmental health but also help homeowners save on long-term costs. His commitment to craftsmanship, integrity, and long-lasting quality is the foundation of every home we build.

  Clarissa is the other half of our partnership—and one of the things that truly sets us apart. She offers a full design consultation included with every home build, working closely with each client to understand how their home needs to function, not just how it should look. From room layout to daily flow, she helps translate your needs into a space that feels intuitive, beautiful, and truly your own—often uncovering possibilities you may not have imagined.

  We offer a free one-time consultation and would love the chance to learn more about your goals. Thank you for taking the time to learn about us. We look forward to meeting you and helping turn your ideas into a home that’s uniquely yours.
