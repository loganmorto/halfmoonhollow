  We started Half Moon Hollow Builders in 2020 with one goal: to build homes and spaces where families can live the lives they truly want. Based in Asheville, NC, we’re a small, hands-on general contracting team that believes personal service makes all the difference.

  We specialize in custom home construction, residential remodeling, and creative design solutions—delivering craftsmanship, attention to detail, and a collaborative process from start to finish. Because we’re a small business, every client gets our full focus and care.

  Whether you’re building from the ground up or reimagining your current space, we’re here to make the process smooth, creative, and rewarding.
