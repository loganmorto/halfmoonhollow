Koi are more than just beautiful additions to your pond — they’re living animals that thrive with proper care. Here’s how to keep your koi healthy:

- **Maintain water quality:** Use test kits to monitor pH, ammonia, and nitrate levels.
- **Feed a high-quality diet:** Choose seasonal koi food and avoid overfeeding.
- **Provide plenty of oxygen:** Add aeration with a waterfall, fountain, or air pump.
- **Watch for signs of illness:** Look out for sluggish behavior, spots, or torn fins.
- **Protect from predators:** Netting and deep water areas help safeguard your fish.

With the right environment and attention, koi can live for decades and become beloved backyard companions.
