Building a pond can be a deeply rewarding project, but thoughtful planning is key to long-term success. Before breaking ground, consider the following:

- **Location matters:** Choose a spot with partial sunlight, away from large trees and runoff.
- **Plan for size and depth:** Koi ponds should be at least 3 feet deep, while smaller water gardens can be shallower.
- **Design with filtration in mind:** A good filter system is the heart of a healthy pond.
- **Think about your style:** Formal or naturalistic? Will you add lighting or a waterfall?
- **Budget for maintenance:** Pumps, filters, food, and seasonal care are ongoing considerations.

Working with a professional can help turn your vision into a long-lasting, low-maintenance feature.
