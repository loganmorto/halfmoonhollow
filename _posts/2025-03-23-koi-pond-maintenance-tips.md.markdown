As winter fades and temperatures rise, spring is the perfect time to refresh and prepare your pond for the year ahead. Here are a few pro tips to ensure your pond stays healthy and beautiful:

- **Clean out debris:** Remove fallen leaves, excess algae, and other organic matter.
- **Check your pump and filtration system:** Clean filters and ensure your pump is working efficiently.
- **Do a partial water change:** Replace 10â€“20% of the water to maintain balance without shocking the system.
- **Inspect liner and plumbing:** Look for damage caused by freezing temperatures.
- **Feed fish sparingly:** As the water warms, gradually reintroduce feeding with a high-quality, seasonal koi food.

A little care early in the season goes a long way in preventing costly issues later on.
